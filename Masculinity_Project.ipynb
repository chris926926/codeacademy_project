    "Welcome to the cumulative project on clustering algorithms! In this project, we will be investigating the way people think about masculinity by applying the KMeans algorithm to data from  <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/\" target = \"_blank\">FiveThirtyEight</a>. FiveThirtyEight is a popular website known for their use of statistical analysis in many of their stories.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, take a look at `masculinity-survey.pdf`. FiveThirtyEight and WNYC studios used this survey to get their male readers' thoughts on masculinity. After looking through some of the questions asked, take a look at FiveThirtyEight's article <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-do-men-think-it-means-to-be-a-man/\" target = \"_blank\">What Do Men Think It Means To Be A Man?</a> to see their major takeaways. We're going to try to find more insights using machine learning.\n",

    "Load `masculinity.csv` into a DataFrame named `survey`. This file contains the raw responses to the masculinity survey. Let's start getting a sense of how this data is structured. Try to answer these questions using your Pandas knowledge:\n",
    "* What are the names of the columns? How do those columns relate to the questions in the PDF?\n",
    "* How many rows are there?\n",
    "* How is a question with multiple parts, like question 7, represented in the DataFrame?\n",
    "* How many people said they often ask a friend for professional advice? This is the first sub-question in question 7.\n",
